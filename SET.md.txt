Tell me rules for "Set" card game


**OpenAI GPT-4.1**
Certainly! Here are the **rules for the Set card game**:

### Set Card Game Rules

#### **Objective**
Find a ‘set’ of three cards among 12 face-up cards. A ‘set’ is a group of three cards where, for each of the card’s four attributes, the attribute is either **all the same or all different** across the three cards.

#### **The Cards**
Each card has **four attributes**:
1. **Color:** red, green, or purple
2. **Shape:** oval, squiggle, or diamond
3. **Number:** one, two, or three symbols
4. **Shading:** solid, striped, or open

So, there are 3×3×3×3 = 81 unique cards.

#### **Gameplay**
1. **Deal 12 cards** face up in a grid.
2. Players look for ‘sets.’  
   - A **set** consists of three cards such that for **each attribute**, the cards are either **all the same** or **all different**.
     - *Example*:  
       Number: one, two, three (**all different**)  
       Color: all red (**all same**)  
       Shape: all squiggle (**all same**)  
       Shading: solid, striped, open (**all different**)  
3. When a player finds a set, they shout “Set!” and indicate the three cards. If the set is valid, the player takes the set.
4. **Replace the three cards** with new cards from the deck, so there are again 12 cards (unless the deck is depleted).
5. If **no set is found** among 12 cards, deal three more to make 15. Repeat until a set is found or the deck is empty.
6. The game continues until the deck is depleted and there are no sets remaining on the table.
7. **Winner:** The player with the most sets collected wins.

#### **Key Points**
- For any attribute, the three cards in a set must either show:
  - **All the same** value (e.g., all cards have two symbols),
  - **All different** values (e.g., one card has one symbol, one has two, one has three).
- All four attributes must satisfy this for it to be a set.

**Example of a valid set**  
Suppose you have the following three cards:

| Card | Color | Shape   | Number | Shading |
|------|-------|---------|--------|---------|
| 1    | Red   | Oval    | 2      | Solid   |
| 2    | Green | Oval    | 2      | Striped |
| 3    | Purple| Oval    | 2      | Open    |

- Color: all different  
- Shape: all the same  
- Number: all the same  
- Shading: all different  

**This is a valid set.**
