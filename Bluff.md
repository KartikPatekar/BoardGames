Tell me rules for Bluff card games


**OpenAI GPT-4.1**
**Bluff** (also known as **Cheat**, **I Doubt It**, **Bullshit** and various other names) is a fun card game for 3 or more players where bluffing is key! Below are the standard rules:

---

## Object of the Game

Be the first player to get rid of all your cards by playing them face down (possibly truthfully or by bluffing) and having your play go unchallenged.

---

## Setup

- Use a standard 52-card deck.
- All cards are dealt as evenly as possible among players. Some may have slightly more cards.
- Players hold their cards in a hand, hidden from others.

---

## Gameplay

1. **First Turn:** The player with the Ace of Spades (sometimes just Ace—house rules vary) usually starts.
2. **Order of Play:** Play proceeds clockwise.
3. **Declaring & Playing:**
    - On each turn, the player must play one or more cards of a specified rank (the rank increases by one each turn: Ace, then 2, then 3, etc.; after King comes Ace again).
    - For example, if “Ace” is called, the player must play any number of cards and declare them as “Aces.” They may actually play any cards (not necessarily Aces), but must declare the correct rank.
    - Example: “Two 8s!” (places two cards face down).
4. **Challenging (Calling Bluff):**
    - After the play, anyone can say “Bluff!”, “Cheat!”, “Bullshit!”, etc.
    - If challenged, the player reveals their cards.
        - **If bluffing:** They pick up the entire pile.
        - **If truthful:** The challenger picks up the pile.
    - The pile is kept centered, and accumulated with each turn.
5. **Continuing Play:**
    - Play continues. After each round, the rank to be played increments (Ace→2→...→King→Ace).
    - When a player runs out of cards, they win.

---

## Additional/Optional Rules

- **Skipping:** If a player can’t play the required rank, they must still play something and bluff or pass (house rules).
- **Wild Cards:** Jokers may be included as wilds.
- **Multiple Cards:** Players may play more than one card per turn.

---

## Example Turn

- The called rank is “Queens.” Player declares “One Queen!” (and places a card face down).
- Next player can challenge the play: “Bluff!” Cards are revealed. If it’s not a Queen, the first player takes all cards in the center.
- If it is a Queen, the challenger takes the cards.

---

## Winning

First player to play all their cards and not get caught bluffing *wins*.

---

## Common Names

- Bluff
- Cheat
- Bullshit
- I Doubt It
- Lie

**Note:** House rules can vary a lot! Always ask your group for custom variations.
