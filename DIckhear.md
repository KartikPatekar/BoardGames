Tell me rules for dickhead card game with special cards 2, 3, 7, 8, J


**OpenAI GPT-4.1**
Certainly! **"Dickhead"** (known as "Shithead" in some places) is a popular shedding card game, usually played with 2–6 players. It's known for its unique rules about playable cards, especially some "special cards" that have extra effects.  
Here are the basic **rules and the effects of 2, 3, 7, 8, J:**

---

## Setup
- Use a standard 52-card deck (no jokers).
- Deal **3 face-down cards** (can't look at them) and **3 face-up cards** to each player.
- Deal **3 cards to each player’s hand**.
- The remaining deck is the **draw pile**.

## Gameplay
- Players take turns playing on a central discard pile.
- **Goal:** Play all your cards (hand, face-up, then face-down).
- On your turn, you must play a card **equal or higher than the top card** of the discard pile.
  - You can play multiples of the same rank together (e.g., three 5s).

---

## **Special Cards** (2, 3, 7, 8, J)

### **2**: *Resets the Pile*
- Playing a 2 resets the pile—ANY card (except another 2) can be played next, regardless of what is under it.

### **3**: *Invisible*
- Acts as if it was NEVER played—the next player ignores it and must play equal to or higher than the card UNDER the 3.
- Example: If the pile is 7, and you play a 3, the next player "looks through" the 3, treating the top as a 7.

### **7**: *Play Below or Equal*
- The next player must play a card **equal to or BELOW 7** (instead of above).
- Multiple 7s reverse again, so after two 7s, it goes back to normal.

### **8**: *Skip*
- Next player is skipped/the turn jumps to the person after them.

### **Jack (J)**: *Reversed Play*
- Direction of play reverses (if you play clockwise, it turns to counterclockwise, etc.).

---

## Other Rules
- If you **cannot play**, you must pick up the entire pile into your hand.
- Always refill your hand from the pile if you have less than 3 cards (until draw pile runs out).
- After playing your hand cards, play your face-up cards.
  - When those finish, play your face-down cards (randomly—you flip to reveal each one).
- The **last person** with cards is the “dickhead.”
