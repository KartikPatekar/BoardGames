Tell me rules for game Jsuto/ Tsuro


**OpenAI GPT-4.1**
**Jsuto** does not appear to be a well-known board game, and may be a typo or confusion with **Tsuro**. If you meant **Tsuro**, here are the rules for the classic board game **Tsuro**:

## Tsuro: The Game of the Path — Basic Rules

**Players:** 2–8  
**Goal:** Be the last player with a stone remaining on the board.

### Components
- Game board  
- 8 player stones (markers)  
- Path tiles (35)  

### Setup
1. Each player selects a stone and places it on any starting marker along the edge of the board.
2. Shuffle the tiles. Each player draws 3 tiles for their hand.

### Gameplay

The game proceeds in turns, clockwise.

#### On Your Turn:
1. **Place a tile:**  
   Choose a tile from your hand and place it adjacent to your stone so the path continues from your current location.
2. **Move your stone:**  
   Follow the path from your stone – *moving along the lines* – until the path ends (could be the edge, another tile, or your own piece).
3. **Draw a tile:**  
   If tiles remain in the stack, draw one to replenish your hand (always 3 tiles).

#### Special Notes:
- If your path causes your stone to reach the board’s edge, you *leave the board* and **are eliminated**.
- If your path leads your stone to collide with another player’s stone, **both are eliminated**.
- If multiple stones move during a turn (because of tile placement), all must follow the paths to completion; resolve all movement before the next turn.
- If you can't place a tile without immediately eliminating yourself, you must choose such a tile.

### Ending the Game
- The game continues until one player remains or no possible moves for anyone.
- That last player is the **winner**!
