Tell me rules for Harry Potter Co-Op codenames


**OpenAI GPT-4.1**
**Harry Potter Co-Op Codenames** is a fan-made cooperative variant of the classic **Codenames** game, themed around the Harry Potter universe.

Here are example rules you can use or adapt for your group (these are based on common fan rules and some official Codenames co-op variants):

# Harry Potter Co-Op Codenames Rules

## Overview
- Play as one team, working together to reveal all the **Order of the Phoenix** members (your team words) before you run out of guesses, while avoiding revealing **Death Eater** words (the opposing team).
- Optional: Add 1 "Voldemort" card as the instant-loss assassin word.

## Setup
- Lay out 25 Harry Potter codenames cards in a 5×5 grid.
- Assign a random key card showing which words correspond to Order of the Phoenix (your team), Death Eaters (opponents), Bystanders (neutral), and Voldemort (assassin).
- Choose one or more **Spymasters**. Everyone else is a guesser.
- Spymaster(s) have access to the key card and provide clues; guessers discuss and pick cards.

## Goal
- Reveal all Order of the Phoenix words before running out of turns or hitting Voldemort.

## Clues
- On each turn, the Spymaster gives a **clue**: one word and one number (e.g., "Magic 2").
    - Clue must relate only to Order words.
    - No clues that reference spelling, sounds, or the position of cards.
- The number represents how many words relate to the clue.

## Guessing
- Guessers discuss and select cards—up to the number in the clue, plus optionally one extra ("+1") guess per turn.
- For each guessed card:
    - If it’s **Order (your team)**: Mark it; you may keep guessing.
    - If it’s **Bystander**: End turn.
    - If it’s **Death Eater**: End turn and lose one "guess token" or turn (see timer below).
    - If it’s **Voldemort (assassin)**: Instant loss.
- Play proceeds until all Order words are found (win), or you hit Voldemort (loss), or run out of allowed guesses/turns (loss).

## Timer / Turns
- You have **9 turns** to find all Order words. Each mistake on a Death Eater card reduces available turns by 1.
- Mark the turn counter visibly.

## Hints & Variants
- For more challenge, keep all clues strictly Harry Potter themed!
- You can substitute game tokens for "Turns Remaining."
- Some variants make all clues related to spells, places, characters, or magical creatures.
