**OpenAI GPT-4.1**
**Fluxx** is a fast, chaotic card game where the rules and the goal constantly change. Here's a summary of how to play, with the core rules and concepts:

# Fluxx – Basic Rules

**1. Goal:**  
There is no fixed goal—the goal can change during the game. Win by meeting the current Goal on the table.

**2. Setup:**  
- Each player is dealt 3 cards.  
- Place the Basic Rules card in the center (Start: Draw 1 card, Play 1 card per turn).  
- Place the draw deck in reach of everyone.

**3. Turns:**
- **Draw:** Draw the number of cards specified by the current Draw rule (usually 1 at the start).
- **Play:** Play the number of cards specified by the Play rule (usually 1 at the start).  
  - You can play any card: New Rule, Keeper, Goal, Action.  
- **End Turn:** Discard—or keep—according to the current Hand/Keep limit rules.

**4. Card Types:**
- **Rule Cards:** Change how the game is played (e.g., Draw 2, Play 3, Hand Limit 2).
- **Goal Cards:** Set the current condition for winning.
- **Keeper Cards:** Played to your table; needed to meet Goals.
- **Action Cards:** One-time effects (e.g., draw cards, steal a Keeper).
- **Surprise Cards:** Override other cards or the rules, timing specified on the card.

**5. Winning:**  
If, **at any point**, you meet the conditions of the current Goal with your Keepers, you win instantly—even between turns!

# Typical Turn Progression

1. Draw cards as allowed by the current rules.
2. Play cards as allowed by the current rules.
    - When you play a New Rule, it takes effect immediately.
    - When you play a Goal, it replaces the current Goal.
    - When you play a Keeper, it goes on the table in front of you.
    - When you play an Action, do what it says, then discard it.
    - Surprise cards can be played any time their condition is met.
3. End your turn. Follow any Hand or Keeper Limits—discard or keep only as many as the rules allow.

# Important Concepts

- **Rules can stack and replace:** If a new Rule contradicts an existing Rule, the new one replaces it.
- **Multiple Limits:** You may have Hand Limit, Keeper Limit, Draw or Play Limit at the same time.
- **Changing Goals:** Only the current Goal counts for victory!
- **Craziness:** The game evolves each turn; expect surprises and chaos.

# Example Cards

- **Goal:** "Chocolate Milk" (requires 'Chocolate' and 'Milk' Keepers).
- **Keeper:** "Chocolate", "Milk".
- **New Rule:** "Draw 4" (Now everyone draws 4 cards).
- **Action:** "Trade Hands" (Give your hand to another player).
- **Surprise:** "Stop That!" (Cancels another player's action).

---

# Quick Reference

- Start: Draw 1, Play 1.
- On your turn: Draw, Play, follow limits.
- First player to meet the current Goal with their Keepers wins.
